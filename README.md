Cassie's hello world repository for Code KY.
> ## Hi, my name is Cassie. 
I'm currently a graphic designer, but I'm interested in learning how to code and expand my skills. I'm interested in web development but I'm open to exploring other things in tech as I learn more. 
Outside of work I enjoy: 
- painting
- gardening
- video games

I'm **excited** to get started!
